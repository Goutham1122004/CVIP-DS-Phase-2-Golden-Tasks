Spam Email Filter using NLP and Machine Learning
Overview
This project aims to develop a robust spam email filter using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The goal is to create an intelligent system capable of accurately classifying emails as either spam or legitimate (ham) based on their content and linguistic features.

Features
Utilizes NLP techniques to extract relevant features from email content.
Implements machine learning algorithms for classification, such as:
Naive Bayes
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Provides data preprocessing steps including:
Tokenization
Stopword removal
Lemmatization or stemming
Includes model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Supports training on custom datasets and testing with unseen email samples.
Usage
Data Collection: Gather a diverse dataset of labeled emails, including both spam and ham examples.
Data Preprocessing: Preprocess the collected data to extract features and remove noise using NLP techniques.
Model Training: Train the machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model to classify incoming emails in real-time.
